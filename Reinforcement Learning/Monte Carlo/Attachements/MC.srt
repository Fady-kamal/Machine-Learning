1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,030
the goal of blackjack is to have a hand

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,170
that totals higher than the dealer's but

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,830
doesn't total to higher than 21 if your

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,099
hand totals higher than 21 it is called

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,490
a bust which means you are out of the

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,449
game the game starts with everyone

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,699
besides the dealer placing a bet then

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,039
the dealer deals one card face up to

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,130
each player and one card face up to

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,579
themselves

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,030
everyone is dealt one more face-up card

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,059
besides the dealer whose second card is

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,780
dealt face down cards 2 through 10 are

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,379
scored using their face value and Jack's

15
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,190
queens and kings are all equal to 10

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,449
aces can be either 1 or 11 and you can

17
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,519
choose their value throughout the round

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,500
if you have one if your two face-up

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,520
cards total 21 you automatically win one

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,470
and a half times your bet from the

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,020
dealer and you're done for that round

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,299
otherwise the dealer asked whether you

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,189
want another card from the top of the

24
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,229
deck if you do say hit or motion toward

25
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,310
yourself with your hand there's no limit

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,369
to how many cards you can ask for but

27
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,490
once your hand totals higher than 21 you

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,110
bust and the dealer gets your bet if you

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,920
don't want any more cards say stay or

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,509
wave your hand over the table once the

31
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,360
dealer has gone around the table they

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,500
flip up their facedown card if it is 16

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,939
or under they have to take another card

34
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,750
if it's 17 or higher they have to stay

35
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,870
with their hand if the deal

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,690
bust every player that's still in that

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,610
round wins twice their bet however if

38
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,489
the dealer doesn't bust only the player

39
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:25,830
whose hands are higher than the dealer's

40
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,430
win twice their bet everyone else loses

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,049
their initial bet once the round is over

42
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,180
all of the players place a new bet and

43
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,220
another round begins
